    <tp:docstring>
      This interface allows clients to receive network time and timezone
      updates broadcast by mobile networks.
    </tp:docstring>

    <property name="NetworkTimezone" type="a{sv}" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        The timezone data provided by the network.  It may include one of more
        of the following fields:

        'offset': offset of the timezone from UTC, in minutes (including DST,
                  if applicable).
        'dst_offset': amount of 'offset' that is due to DST, in minutes.
        'leap_seconds': number of leap seconds included in the network time.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <method name="GetNetworkTime">
      <tp:docstring>
        Gets the current network time.

        This method will only work if the modem tracks, or can request, the
        current network time; it will not attempt to use previously-received
        network time updates on the host to guess the current network time.

          If the network time is known, a string containing a date and time in
